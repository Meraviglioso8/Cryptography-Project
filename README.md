# A MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION-BASED IN CLOUD APPLICATIONS #

## 1. **Abstract** ##

 A security mechanism is applied to the cloud application that includes
user registration, granting user privileges, and generating user authentication factor. An intrusion detection system is embedded to the security mechanism to detect malicious users. The multi factor authentication, intrusion detection, and access control techniques can be used for ensuring the identity of the user.

## 2. **Motivation** ##
User’s data is considered as a vital asset of several organizations. Migrating data to the cloud computing is not an easy decision for any
organization due to the privacy and security concerns. Service providers must ensure that both data and applications that will be stored on the cloud should be protected in a secure environment. The data stored on the public cloud will be vulnerable to outside and inside attacks.
